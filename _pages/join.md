## General information

Welcome! We're so glad you're interested in working with us. To learn more about how to apply to the lab, see the section for your career stage below.

### Expectations of all lab members

Before applying, make sure that you are all right with the following expectations:

- Make an honest and good faith effort to accomplish the work you commit to.

- Contribute to a positive lab environment. This means treating all other lab members with respect and following the [code of conduct](wiki/code_of_conduct).

- Be committed to practicing open science to the best of your ability while you are in the lab. This includes (inspired by the [DIB lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/philosophy.html#open-science)): 1) making all research code available under an open source license (our default is the MIT License, but we're open to others), 2) submitting all papers to preprint servers unless there is a compelling reason not to, 3) making data and/or configuration files for your projects publicly available, and 4) erring on the side of collaborating with others rather than competing.

## Prospective undergraduate students

The number of undergraduate students that our lab can accommodate depends on the capacity of our other lab members to mentor them. As we build up the number of experienced graduate students in the lab, we will start more actively searching for undergraduate lab members. For now, we still welcome applications from interested students, but will likely have to turn a number down.

If you are interested in applying for an undergraduate research position in our lab, [e-mail Emily Dolson](mailto:emilyldolson@gmail.com) and include the following information:

- Why you are interested in working in this lab?

- Why are you interested in doing research in general? What are you career plans for after you graduate?

- What is your level of programming experience?

- What is your level of biology experience? (it's okay if the answer is none as long as you're open to learning some!)

- Do you have experience in other areas of science?

- Have you done research before? If so, describe it.

- Which track (see below) are you interested in?

There are three different tracks for undergraduate students in this lab (although the boundaries between them are fuzzy and you can absolutely switch):

### Computational research

Qualifications: In most cases, students seeking to do this kind of research should be competent at programming in C++. For MSU students, this usually means having taken CSE 232.

This is the standard research track, and is most similar to what graduate students in the lab do. Undergraduate students
on this track will choose a bite-sized research project (often a chunk of a larger project that another lab member
is working on). They will then (assuming all goes well) take that project through its full life cycle: 1) writing any code necessary to run the digital experiments for that project, 2) running those experiments, 3) analyzing the data, and 4) writing the paper. Over the course of this work, the student will receive help and mentorship from whichever lab member is assigned to be their mentor.

### Research software development

Qualifications: In most cases, students seeking to do this kind of research should be competent at programming in C++. For MSU students, this usually means having taken CSE 232.

Because we are in the Computer Science and Engineering department, we often get students who are more interested in software development than research. Conveniently, scientific software development is a very important part of what we do, and often one that other lab members don't have the bandwidth to take on. So we very much welcome undergraduate students who are interested in focusing on this area!

The general process for participating in software development in our lab is as follows:

1. Start out by writing tests for parts of our code that are currently missing them. This will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with our codebase in a gentle way while also making a valuable contribution.

2. Once you're ready, we'll choose a specific open software development problem that you're interested in working on and you'll work on it.

### Low-code biology research

Qualifications: Students interested in this track do not need to be competent in any programming language, but must be open to learning one (and experience with Python or R is a major plus). Additionally, students interested in this track should have some biology background.

We haven't actually tried this one yet, so whenever we actually do it will be a bit of an experiment. The idea is that it is designed for biology students without much programming experience. For these students, the amount of up front technical skills that many projects in the lab require learning can be overwhelming (a typical project requires coding in a combination of C++, python, bash, and R). These projects should only require writing code (probably in R) to analyze the data. This is a much more manageable amount of learning to do in the context of undergraduate research.

Within the lab, we can pretty easily put together a piece of software designed to address a specific question about ecological and/or evolutionary theory. We can also fairly easily give it a user-friendly interface that doesn't require programming to interact with. The bottleneck is more often generating and analyzing the data. So if you want to work on one of these types of projects, we will follow the following process:

1. Discuss possible project ideas and identify one that everyone involved seems excited about.

2. The student will read papers to familiarize themself with the chosen topic while a different lab member puts together the code to run the experiment.

3. The student will run the code (probably through a graphical interface on a web browser) to generate all of the data they need.

4. The student will analyze the data (with guidance from other lab members).

5. Assuming it makes sense based on the specifics of the project, the results, and the student's interest and time, the student will have the opportunity to take the lead on writing any resulting paper. They will be supported in this endeavor by the other lab members they are working with. We will talk more about the specifics of this once we get to this point in a project.

## Prospective graduate students

We are actively seeking applications from PhD students. If you are interested in doing your PhD with us,
[e-mail Emily Dolson](mailto:emilyldolson@gmail.com) and include the following information:

- Why you are interested in working in this lab. Which part of our research are you excited about contributing to?

- Why are you interested in doing a PhD in general? What are you career plans for after you graduate?

- What is your level of programming experience? What is your level of computer science experience? Note that these are two subtly different things. Some ability to write code is necessary to be a successful graduate student in this lab (although obviously you'll learn a lot over the course of graduate school - we don't expect you to be an expert at the beginning). Formal training in computer science is less critical, although it is helpful as our home department is [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.msu.edu). If you have some programming experience but no formal computer science background there are a range of options we can discuss.

- What is your level of biology experience? (it's okay if the answer is none as long as you're open to learning some!)

- Do you have experience in other areas of science?

- Have you done research before? If so, describe it.

## Prospective post-docs

While we do not currently have funding available for any post-doctoral positions,
we are very much open adding post-docs to the lab if their expertise is the right
fit. Most likely, this would take the form of applying for funding together. Because
of the timeline for most funding applications, we recommend that you contact us at
least a year before you are hoping to start a postdoctoral position. We're happy to
discuss options on a tighter time scale as well - there will just likely be fewer options.

Some funding opportunities that may be a good fit for post-docs interested in joining the ECODE lab include the following. Some of these require an explicit mentor and others do not:

- [The MSU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://eeb.msu.edu/initiatives/postdoctoral-fellowship/)
  
- [JSMF Postdoctoral Fellowship Awards](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/) (this is not intended for people who have definitively identified a postdoc advisor, but if you're still exploring your options and are the sort of person who might be a good fit for the ECODE lab it is likely one that you should be aware of)

- [NIH F32](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/f32) (if you're interested in the more medically-oriented applications of our research)

- [NSF Biology Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb) (the topics for a given year can be hit or miss, but are sometimes a good fit)

- [Mozilla Fellowships](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships/) (these are generally more about improving the infrastructure for open science and technology than about doing research, but I very much support those goals and am happy to serve as a mentor on such projects where appropriate)

The other option for securing funding is that we can potentially write you into a larger grant. As a new lab, we're writing a lot of grants, so this is a real option. [E-mail Emily Dolson](mailto:emilyldolson@gmail.com) to discuss this further.

Emails from prospective post-docs should include a fairly detailed description of why you are interested in this lab specifically and what type of research question you would be interested in persuing.
